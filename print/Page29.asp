We aim to give our clients what they want by investigating what it is that their customers need.  We need to understand what your success factors are and what both your short and long term objectives are. By doing this we can often save you money by putting in place the building blocks for tomorrow.</p><p>Our Strategy Department blends traditional Account Planning and User-centered Design Experts to develop a deep understanding of customer needs, preferences and behaviours and then translates that understanding into a strategy that satisfies both customer and business goals.  Over the years we have developed methodology tools which really help extract end user needs and requirements.  After all the ultimate goal is a change in behaviour and or attitude.</p><p>We also use research throughout and after the development of the solution to audit usability, accessibility and navigation, content features and functionality, and any key areas of user resistance or objection.</p><p>Once a site is up, we can analyse traffic and user profiles exhaustively to assess whether the site is attracting the right sort of visitors and whether their behaviour on the site meets your objectives.  Additionally we advise on natural search optimisation.</p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
