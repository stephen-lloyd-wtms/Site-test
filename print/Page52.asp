The design for the website was conducted by the Number 10 design team and XM London built these designs into a templated structure based around our content management system, NetDevPlus. Staff at Number 10 use the CMS to update the website on a daily basis.</p><p>Accessibility in terms of good accessible code and an easily comprehensible site were of great importance to Number 10. The site has been coded to strict accessibility guidelines and includes other helpful elements, such as skip navigation key. The site meets DUBLIN core and WC3 recommendation; has passed both Bobby level 'A' and WAVE test; and has been comprehensively tested to be viewable and workable across a wide spectrum of different browser set-ups.<br /> <br />The site includes daily news updates, schedules, progress on manifesto commitments, a history of its past occupants as well as views of staterooms. There are also live broadcasts of 10 Downing Street and PM's Questions, and an Email the PM facility.</p><p><a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.number10.gov.uk</a></p><p><img alt="No10 Downing Street" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_no10_a.jpg" width="280" /></p><p><img alt="No10 Downing Street" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_no10_b.jpg" width="280" /></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
