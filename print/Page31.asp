They manage the creative, programming, testing and site administration resources. </p><p>The account/project manager will ensure staffing is constantly managed with the appropriate members of the core and extended team resourced according to requirement and scheduled tasks. This team will work closely together to ensure that the project can continue to be managed at the same level during the project lifetime.</p><p>XM London has a tried and tested approach to managing projects and uses a methodology that scales to fit the size, scope and nature of the work. Our approach follows the six-phase process outlined below:</p><p><img alt="6 Phase Process" border="0" height="286" src="/files/images/Process New.jpg" width="470" /></p><p> </p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
