To position them as the leading provider for Women's Health, we created the Femalelife site to empower women with knowledge relating to their bodies, sex, health and fertility control.</p><p>The site took a consumer focussed view of the subject areas using a lifestage approach with appropriate design, content and tonality. The content was presented in such a way as to help users find what method of contraception is right for them. Once interest was generated in a product, they were invited to consult their physician for more information.</p><p>Alongside the International version, local market sites were rolled out in their native languages.</p><p><img alt="Female Life website" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_FemLife_1.jpg" width="280" /></p><p><img alt="Female Life website" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_FemLife_1a.jpg" width="280" /></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
