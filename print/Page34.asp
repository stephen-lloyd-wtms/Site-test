They not only look good but they really work, it's about the intelligence and creativity of our solutions. We absolutely believe that creativity is a state of mind and not just a department.</p><p>Whilst our staff's skill sets fall across a number of areas we primarily work in a team structure, each of the teams have particular knowledge and expertise of various market sectors. This means we capture and keep knowledge within a team.</p><p>We believe the best results are achieved by working closely in collaboration with our Clients and creating a strong team ethos as your partners in the online environment. Whilst we have deep experience and expertise, you have key insights and understandings of your customers, competitors and the current issues which are vital to ensure that the solution meets your objectives.</p><p>All of our digital solutions are based around a robust visitor centric methodology which aims to motivate and, where necessary, change visitor behaviour. We place great importance on extracting and analysing varying target audience needs and attitudes as well as establishing the key communication messages for the website.</p><p>Our projects are managed using a <a href="/output/Page31.asp">six-stage process methodology.</a></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
