The website encourages the public to become involved by allowing users to raise their awareness of new topics, read about speakers through their biographies, order tickets and post questions to speakers online.</p><p>The Debates are broadcast on the BBC World Service - the site allows users to find out broadcast times, order DVDs of past programs, and read transcripts of all past debates.<br /> The first iteration of the site has gone live and the second stage, the Arabic translation, will go live in the near future.</p><p>We are responsible for all training and development of the site going forward.</p><p><a href="http://www.thedohadebates.com" target="_blank">http://www.thedohadebates.com</a></p><p><img alt="The Doha Debates website" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_doha_1.jpg" width="280" /></p><p><img alt="The Doha Debates website" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_doha_1a.jpg" width="280" /></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
