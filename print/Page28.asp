We have developed brand manuals, customisable presenters for sales teams, customer-facing promotions, and CDs that help companies with internal staff training, guidance and motivation. As in everything we do, start with the target audience and work backwards to develop the brief and establish what they need, before letting our creative and technical teams loose on the project.</p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
