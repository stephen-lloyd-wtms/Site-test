The objective of the site was to enable visitors to get a good idea of the University, its campuses, student and accommodation facilities. One of the requirements for the site was for it to be practical, interactive and user friendly thereby enabling visitors to engage with it. An additional benefit of the website was that people unable to visit the University on an open day would still be able to get a feel of what Kingston is like. <br /><br />The site was therefore developed using Flash and html and provided a comprehensive overview of all the individual campuses, student Unions and learning centres. Images and Videos were also used to give a visual perspective to each section of the university campuses as well as directions on how to get there. </p><p><a href="http://extranet.kingston.ac.uk/kuvirtualtour/output/Page1.asp" target="_blank">View: Virtual Tour</a><br /><br /><strong>Get Further Website</strong></p><p>Following the design and development of the virtual tour site for Kingston University, we were once again commissioned to design &amp; develop an educational website aimed at 14-15 year olds. The objectives of the site were fourfold:</p><ul><li>To encourage, inspire and motivate students from lower socio-economic groups to consider Higher Education Institutions by communicating the real opportunities that HEI offer</li><li>To develop a renewable and accessible website resource to broaden understanding and engagement in HE</li><li>To support Kingston University's commitment to widening participation</li><li>To support the Government's pledge for participation in HE</li></ul><p>In order to understand the target audience, XM London further undertook focus group workshops with participating schools in Walton-upon-Thames &amp; Richmond. The site was developed using html and Cascading Style Sheets.<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.getfurther.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.getfurther.co.uk/</a></p><p><a href="#topNavigation">Back to top</a></p><p><img alt="Virtual Tour" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_KUtour_1.jpg" width="280" /></p><p><img alt="KU - Virtual Tour" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_KUtour_1_lrg.jpg" width="280" /></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img alt="Kingston University" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_KUedu_1_lrg.jpg" width="280" /></p><p><img alt="Kingston University" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_KUedu_1a_lrg.jpg" width="280" /></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
