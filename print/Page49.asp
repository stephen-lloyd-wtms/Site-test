The designs needed to be flexible enough to allow for incremental growth and modularity and work within the information structure that the National Trust built up themselves. The website needed to work hard to inspire present and future generations and to encourage investment with the National Trust, either through time or money. We provided strategic advice and a new information architecture for the site.<br /><br />The website needed to be able to reach as wide an audience as possible without discriminating against any user; consequently the website was designed with full usability in mind.</p><p><a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk</a></p><p><img alt="National Trust" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_natTrust_1a_lrg.jpg" width="280" /></p><p><img alt="National Trust" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_natTrust_1a_lrg.jpg" width="280" /></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
