The site is targeted primarily at SMEs and small business advisors, and launched in July 2004</p><p>BITC's immediate objective was to launch a holding site to support the publication of the URL in the Business Advisor magazine. We suggested the inclusion of a registration form from the onset in order to capture business advisors' details, and to alert them to the launch of the full site</p><p>We designed, built and launched the holding site within 7 days of appointment, ensuring that the registration form and business briefings could be re-used in the final site. The Small Business Journey's primary business objective is to disseminate information on responsible business practice to SMEs and is part-funded by the DTI. BITC will maintain the site post-launch using <a href="http://www.netdevplus.com/" target="_blank">XM's content management system.</a></p><p><a href="http://www.smallbusinessjourney.com" target="_blank">http://www.smallbusinessjourney.com</a></p><p><img alt="Small Business Journey Home" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_smbusiness_1_lrg.jpg" width="280" /></p><p><img alt="Small Business Journey" border="0" height="195" src="/files/images/XM_L3_histories_smbusiness_1a_lrg.jpg" width="280" /></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
