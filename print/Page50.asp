We created a site for the Duchy of Lancaster to communicate its role in the 21st Century and information on its history. Content is clustered into two main channels, the history and records of the Duchy, and the Management of the Duchy of Lancaster estate.</p><p>The site Includes a directory of tenants and an interactive boundary map of the Duchy's holdings. The site is built to comply with W3C and accessibility guidelines. Content is managed via our Content Management System so that staff can easily update information when required.
