Some clients will use all of our services, others will work with just a couple of our departments. So whether it is a pure play consultancy project or a situation where we run and host clients, intranet, extranet and consumer facing sites, we have the resource in place to offer support.</p><p>The people who make up XM London boast a variety of different skills. We are skilled and experienced in just about every digital area, from search engine submission and email marketing, to websites, intranets and extranets, as well as CD-ROMs, mobile and in-store kiosk design.</p><p>Our broad experience and the ability to come up with the appropriate solution for different requirements enables us to be channel-neutral. We do not have a vested interest in any one digital solution or any one digital medium. We only want what's right for you. Or more to the point, what's right for your customers and your potential customers. Whatever it is, we'll find it, and we'll execute it.</p><p>As a full service company we have four key areas of expertise. For some companies we supply a full 360 degree service where we host and run their websites, intranets, extranets and email, whilst for others, we provide strategic consultancy.  Our hosting services have been and are regularly audited by Government agencies and HSBC.</p><p>We are split into four departments <a href="/output/Page28.asp">Creative/Design</a>, <a href="/output/Page29.asp">Strategy</a>, <a href="/output/Page30.asp">Technical and Hosting</a> and <a href="/output/Page31.asp">Account/Project Management</a></p><img class="hide" src="/files/images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" />
